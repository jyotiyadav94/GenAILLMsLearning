# Finetuning Large Language Models Course

## Overview
Welcome to the "Finetuning Large Language Models" course, presented by Sharon Zhou, Co-Founder and CEO of Lamini. Sharon is also the instructor for the GANs Specialization and How Diffusion Models Work. In this course, you will gain valuable insights into the process of finetuning large language models (LLMs) and enhance your ability to tailor these models to your specific needs.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, you will be equipped to:
1. **Understand Finetuning:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of when and why to apply finetuning on Large Language Models.
2. **Data Preparation:** Learn how to prepare your data effectively for the finetuning process.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Acquire the skills to train and evaluate an LLM on your own data.

## Why Finetuning?
- **Customization:** Finetuning allows you to use your own data to train the model, enabling customization based on your specific requirements.
- **Weight Update:** Update the weights of neural networks in the LLM, differentiating it from methods like prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- **Learning Style and Form:** Finetuning empowers the model to learn style and form, making it more adaptable to your preferences.
- **Knowledge Integration:** The model can be updated with new knowledge during finetuning, leading to continuous improvement and enhanced results.

## How to Benefit
To make the most of this course, follow these key steps:
1. **Understand Finetuning Principles:** Grasp the core principles behind when and how to apply finetuning.
2. **Effective Data Preparation:** Learn best practices for preparing your data to optimize the finetuning process.
3. **Hands-On Model Training:** Gain practical experience in training and evaluating an LLM on your own data through hands-on exercises.
